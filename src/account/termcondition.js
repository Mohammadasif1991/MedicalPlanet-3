          Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting
          industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever
          since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and
          scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only
          five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting,
          remaining essentially unchanged. ReactJS is an open-source,
          component-based front end library responsible only for the view layer
          of the application. It is maintained by Facebook. React uses a
          declarative paradigm that makes it easier to reason about your
          application and aims to be both efficient and flexible. It designs
          simple views for each state in your application, and React will
          efficiently update and render just the right component when your data
          changes. The declarative view makes your code more predictable and
          easier to debug. A React application is made of multiple components,
          each responsible for rendering a small, reusable piece of HTML.
          Components can be nested within other components to allow complex
          applications to be built out of simple building blocks. A component
          may also maintain an internal state â€“ for example, a TabList component
          may store a variable corresponding to the currently open tab.
